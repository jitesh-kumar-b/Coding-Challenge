# Coding-Challenge

The objective of the task is to fetch top 10 starred repositories from GitHub that is written in python and created last month.

The code that I have built can be used in two ways: 
1. Dynamically fetching the Timestamp/date: which means whenever the code runs it will display the repositories created since last month, without fixing the date parameter.
2. Fetching user input(code is commented): user can provide any created date from which the data needs to be extracted.

The program run & test is done in Google Colab and later cloned into Github. Google Colab link is also provided above the code.

Libraries used: requests, Pandas, datetime, timedelta and date. 

Proceeding further, the code has been implemented as per the requirement, which has been briefly described in the main documentation.

Please find the output of this code in **repofile.txt**.
